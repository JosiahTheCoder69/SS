        <!-- Quebec Independence Movement -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Quebec Independence Movement</h2>
            <h3>Essential Question</h3>
            <p>What is the Quebec Independence Movement and how has it affected Canada?</p>

            <h3>After Independence</h3>
            <p>Canada received its independence but still had close ties to England, which caused problems. Many French Canadians felt England had too much influence.</p>

            <h3>Rivalry</h3>
            <p>French Canadians, mostly in Quebec, have historically felt outnumbered and unheard compared to English Canadians.</p>

            <h3>French Canadians in WWI</h3>
            <p>Many French Canadians opposed Canada’s involvement in WWI, believing it only helped England. They felt their opinions were ignored.</p>

            <h3>Change in Quebec</h3>
            <p>Quebec was originally a French colony. Over time, more English speakers moved in, making French Canadians fear losing their language and culture.</p>

            <h3>French Nationalism</h3>
            <p>Many Quebec residents identified as French Canadians rather than just Canadians. Some wanted Quebec to secede and form its own country.</p>

            <h3>Quebec Independence Votes</h3>
            <p>Quebec held independence referendums in 1980 and 1995. Both times, voters chose to stay in Canada, with the 1995 vote being very close (49.4% for secession, 50.6% against).</p>

            <h3>Quebec’s Status Today</h3>
            <p>Quebec did not secede but gained equal status within Canada. French remains one of Canada’s official languages.</p>
