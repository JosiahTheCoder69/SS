        <!-- Quebec Independence Movement -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Quebec Independence Movement</h2>
            <h3>Essential Question</h3>
            <p>What is the Quebec Independence Movement and how has it affected Canada?</p>

            <h3>After Independence</h3>
            <p>Canada received its independence but still had close ties to England, which caused problems. Many French Canadians felt England had too much influence.</p>

            <h3>Rivalry</h3>
            <p>French Canadians, mostly in Quebec, have historically felt outnumbered and unheard compared to English Canadians.</p>

            <h3>French Canadians in WWI</h3>
            <p>Many French Canadians opposed Canada’s involvement in WWI, believing it only helped England. They felt their opinions were ignored.</p>

            <h3>Change in Quebec</h3>
            <p>Quebec was originally a French colony. Over time, more English speakers moved in, making French Canadians fear losing their language and culture.</p>

            <h3>French Nationalism</h3>
            <p>Many Quebec residents identified as French Canadians rather than just Canadians. Some wanted Quebec to secede and form its own country.</p>

            <h3>Quebec Independence Votes</h3>
            <p>Quebec held independence referendums in 1980 and 1995. Both times, voters chose to stay in Canada, with the 1995 vote being very close (49.4% for secession, 50.6% against).</p>

            <h3>Quebec’s Status Today</h3>
            <p>Quebec did not secede but gained equal status within Canada. French remains one of Canada’s official languages.</p>

            <h2>Canada: Culture, History, and Identity</h2>

            <h3>Symbols of Canada</h3>
            <p>Canada's symbols include the beaver, representing the fur trade, and the maple leaf, symbolizing the nation's vast wilderness. Hockey is also a major part of Canadian identity.</p>

            <h3>Canada and the U.S.</h3>
            <p>Although Canada and the U.S. share a long border and cultural similarities, Canadians developed a distinct identity. Canada gained independence from Britain differently, and many Canadians take pride in their healthcare system and social policies.</p>

            <h3>Canada's Economy</h3>
            <p>Canada is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals. It has one of the world's strongest economies.</p>

            <h3>Canadian Government</h3>
            <p>Canada is a parliamentary democracy. The Prime Minister is the head of government, and the Queen of England is the ceremonial head of state. Parliament consists of the House of Commons and the Senate.</p>

            <h3>Life at the Border</h3>
            <p>The U.S.-Canada border, once known as the "world's longest undefended border," became more closely monitored after the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>

            <h3>Quebec’s Role</h3>
            <p>Quebec has played a key role in Canadian identity, with many French-speaking residents advocating for independence. Although a 1995 referendum to secede narrowly failed, Quebec has maintained its distinct language and culture.</p>

            <h3>Canadian Pride</h3>
            <p>Hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics helped Canada embrace national pride, especially after the men's hockey team won gold against the U.S.</p>
