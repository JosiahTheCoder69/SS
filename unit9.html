            <h2>Australia's History</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to explain the impact of European settlement on the Indigenous people of Australia.</p>

            <h3>Indigenous Australians</h3>
            <p>Aboriginal Australians have lived on the continent for over 65,000 years. They have a deep connection to the land and rich cultural traditions.</p>

            <h3>European Exploration and Colonization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1770:</b> British Sea Captain James Cook explored Australia and claimed it for Britain.</li>
                <li><b>1788:</b> The First Fleet arrived at Sydney, establishing Australia as a penal colony.</li>
                <li>By 1852, there were over 150,000 convicts in Australia.</li>
                <li>Eventually, free settlers arrived, and Australia expanded.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact on the Aboriginal People</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The British settled in coastal areas, displacing Indigenous Australians.</li>
                <li>Many Aboriginal people died from diseases brought by Europeans.</li>
                <li>Europeans had superior weapons, which led to conflicts and massacres.</li>
                <li>Some Aboriginal tribes, like those in Tasmania, were completely wiped out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Australia Becomes a Nation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1901:</b> Australia became an independent country.</li>
                <li>Government policies attempted to erase Aboriginal culture by restricting where they could live and work.</li>
                <li>In the 1960s, Australia began recognizing Indigenous rights, but very few Aboriginal people remain today.</li>
            </ul>
