            <h2>The Treaty of Versailles</h2>
            <p>After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles placed harsh reparations on
            Germany, leading to economic depression and setting the stage for further
            conflict. The treaty included several key restrictions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Germany was forced to accept full responsibility for the war, under the "War Guilt" clause.</li>
                <li><strong>Reparations:</strong> Germany was required to pay huge sums of money to the Allies, which devastated its economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Land:</strong> Germany lost significant territories, which further weakened the country.</li>
                <li><strong>Military:</strong> Severe restrictions were placed on the size and strength of the German military.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Global Depression</h2>
            <p>The worldwide depression that followed World War I affected not only Germany but also economies across Europe and the United States:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Germany:</strong> The Treaty of Versailles caused Germany to plunge into economic depression. The reparations payments led to inflation, unemployment, and widespread poverty.</li>
                <li><strong>Worldwide Impact:</strong> Countries around the world, especially in Europe, struggled with war debts and economic devastation. Inflation, unemployment, and property damage were rampant.</li>
                <li><strong>United States:</strong> The U.S. fell into the Great Depression in 1929 after the stock market crash. Businesses closed, unemployment soared, and many lost their homes and livelihoods.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Businesses globally traded with the U.S., and when the U.S. economy collapsed, it had ripple effects across the world, exacerbating the depression.</p>
