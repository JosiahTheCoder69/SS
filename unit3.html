            <h2>The Treaty of Versailles</h2>
            <p>After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles placed harsh reparations on Germany, leading to economic depression and setting the stage for further conflict.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Germany was forced to accept full responsibility for the war.</li>
                <li><strong>Reparations:</strong> Germany was required to pay huge sums of money to the Allies.</li>
                <li><strong>Military:</strong> Severe restrictions were placed on the size of the German military.</li>

            <h2>The Global Depression</h2>
            <p>The worldwide depression affected economies across Europe and the United States:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The U.S. fell into the Great Depression in 1929 after the stock market crash.</li>
                <li>Germany faced hyperinflation and widespread poverty due to reparations.</li>
                <li>The interconnectedness of global economies meant that the collapse of one major economy affected others.</li>
