        <!-- Impact of Poverty and War -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Impact of Poverty and the War on Drugs</h2>
            <p>Poverty remains a major challenge in many Latin American countries. Inequalities in wealth distribution have left a significant portion of the population struggling for basic needs, such as food, education, and healthcare.</p>
            <p>The war on drugs has further complicated economic and social conditions. Countries like Mexico and Colombia face violence and instability caused by drug cartels, impacting local economies and governance.</p>

        <!-- Migration to the United States -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Migration to the United States</h2>
            <p>Economic hardship, violence, and political instability drive many Latin Americans to migrate to the U.S. in search of better opportunities. Migrants often send remittances back to their families, contributing to the economies of their home countries.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Location, Physical Features, and Resources -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Location, Physical Features, and Natural Resources</h2>
            <p>Latin America’s geography includes vast rainforests like the Amazon, mountain ranges like the Andes, and major rivers such as the Amazon River. These physical features play a vital role in the region’s economy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Resources:</strong> Rich in oil, natural gas, and minerals, Latin America is a major global exporter of these resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Trade Routes:</strong> The Panama Canal is a key passage for global trade, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Voluntary Trade and Specialization -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Voluntary Trade and Specialization</h2>
            <p>Latin America benefits from voluntary trade, which allows countries to focus on producing goods they specialize in. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brazil:</strong> Exports coffee, soybeans, and iron ore.</li>
                <li><strong>Chile:</strong> Known for copper mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Argentina:</strong> Major exporter of beef and agricultural products.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Trade Barriers and NAFTA -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Trade Barriers and NAFTA</h2>
            <p>Trade barriers like tariffs and quotas have historically limited economic growth in Latin America. However, agreements like NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) have encouraged free trade, boosting economies in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Literacy Rate and Human Development -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Literacy Rate and Human Development</h2>
            <p>Education plays a crucial role in improving economic conditions. Countries with higher literacy rates often have stronger economies. Investments in human capital (education and healthcare) lead to higher productivity and GDP growth.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Entrepreneurship and Capital Goods -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Entrepreneurship and Capital Goods</h2>
            <p>Entrepreneurship drives innovation and economic growth in Latin America. Investing in capital goods, like machinery and infrastructure, further boosts productivity and the region’s global competitiveness.</p>
