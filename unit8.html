        <!-- Canada’s Environmental Issues -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Environmental Issues</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to identify and describe Canada’s three major environmental issues.</p>

            <h3>Human-Environment Interaction</h3>
            <p>Humans either **adapt** to their environment or **change** it. Canada faces several major environmental challenges caused by human activity.</p>

            <h3>1. Pollution of the Great Lakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Caused by **waste dumping, run-off, and acid rain**.</li>
                <li>Industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals harm aquatic life.</li>
                <li>Acid rain, caused by coal-burning factories and vehicle emissions, makes water toxic.</li>
                <li>Pollution leads to deformities in fish, contaminated drinking water, and human health risks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Mining in the Canadian Shield</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Home to rich deposits of **gold, silver, nickel, and copper**.</li>
                <li>Mining contaminates **soil and water**, disrupting ecosystems.</li>
                <li>Causes **human health issues** due to pollution.</li>
                <li>Short-term economic gain, but long-term environmental damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Deforestation of Timber</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Canada’s **Boreal Forest** is over 10,000 years old.</li>
                <li>Logging for paper and industry destroys animal habitats (e.g., woodland caribou, red fox).</li>
                <li>Forests are a **limited resource**, and deforestation harms biodiversity.</li>
                <li>Cutting trees faster than they can regrow leads to **permanent loss**.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Canada’s Economy -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Economy</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to answer Canada’s basic economic questions.</p>

            <h3>Economic System</h3>
            <p>Canada has a **mixed economy**, closer to a **market economy**. Private businesses make most decisions, but the government controls some industries, like healthcare.</p>

            <h3>What to Produce?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Canada specializes in **energy, agriculture, and manufacturing**.</li>
                <li>Largest supplier of **energy** to the U.S.</li>
                <li>One of the **largest wheat and grain producers**.</li>
                <li>Produces as many **automobiles** as the U.S.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Produce?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mostly decided by **businesses and corporations**.</li>
                <li>Some industries, like **healthcare**, are **government-funded**.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Whom to Produce?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most food is produced for **Canada**.</li>
                <li>Most **exports (energy, resources)** go to the **United States**.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Canada has **abundant natural resources**.</li>
                <li>Major industries include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Energy:** Oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power.</li>
                        <li>**Agriculture:** Wheat, grain, livestock.</li>
                        <li>**Manufacturing:** Cars, machinery, technology.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Specialization & Diversification</h3>
            <p>**Over-specialization** can make a country **too dependent** on others. **Diversification** ensures economic stability by producing a variety of goods.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Canada’s Government -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Government</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to explain how Canada’s government works.</p>

            <h3>Government Type</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Parliamentary Democracy** – Citizens elect Members of Parliament.</li>
                <li>**Constitutional Monarchy** – King/Queen is Head of State but has no real power.</li>
                <li>**Federal System** – Power is divided between national and provincial governments.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Parliament</h3>
            <p>Canada’s **legislative branch** is called **Parliament**. It has two houses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>House of Commons:</b> Elected representatives.</li>
                <li><b>Senate:</b> Members appointed by the Prime Minister.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prime Minister</h3>
            <p>The leader of the political party with the most seats in Parliament becomes the **Prime Minister**.</p>

            <h3>Branches of Government</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Executive Branch:</b> Prime Minister, Cabinet.</li>
                <li><b>Legislative Branch:</b> Parliament (House of Commons & Senate).</li>
                <li><b>Judicial Branch:</b> Canada’s court system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Role of Citizens</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Citizens **vote for Members of Parliament**.</li>
                <li>They elect **regional leaders (provincial governors)**.</li>
                <li>They vote on important issues, like **Quebec’s independence referendums**.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Comparison to the U.S.</h3>
            <p>Unlike the **Presidential Democracy** in the U.S., where citizens directly elect the President, in Canada, **Parliament selects the Prime Minister**.</p>

            <h3>Quebec’s Role</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Many in Quebec identify as **French Canadian**.</li>
                <li>They held **independence referendums** in **1980** and **1995**.</li>
                <li>Both failed, but the **1995 vote was very close (49.4% wanted to secede, 50.6% voted to stay).**</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Participation & Democracy</h3>
            <p>Canada’s citizens enjoy **personal freedoms** and **democratic rights**, but participation in elections is key to maintaining democracy.</p>
        </div>
                <!-- Quebec Independence Movement -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Quebec Independence Movement</h2>
            <h3>Essential Question</h3>
            <p>What is the Quebec Independence Movement and how has it affected Canada?</p>

            <h3>After Independence</h3>
            <p>Canada received its independence but still had close ties to England, which caused problems. Many French Canadians felt England had too much influence.</p>

            <h3>Rivalry</h3>
            <p>French Canadians, mostly in Quebec, have historically felt outnumbered and unheard compared to English Canadians.</p>

            <h3>French Canadians in WWI</h3>
            <p>Many French Canadians opposed Canada’s involvement in WWI, believing it only helped England. They felt their opinions were ignored.</p>

            <h3>Change in Quebec</h3>
            <p>Quebec was originally a French colony. Over time, more English speakers moved in, making French Canadians fear losing their language and culture.</p>

            <h3>French Nationalism</h3>
            <p>Many Quebec residents identified as French Canadians rather than just Canadians. Some wanted Quebec to secede and form its own country.</p>

            <h3>Quebec Independence Votes</h3>
            <p>Quebec held independence referendums in 1980 and 1995. Both times, voters chose to stay in Canada, with the 1995 vote being very close (49.4% for secession, 50.6% against).</p>

            <h3>Quebec’s Status Today</h3>
            <p>Quebec did not secede but gained equal status within Canada. French remains one of Canada’s official languages.</p>
