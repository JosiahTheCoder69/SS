        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Environmental Issues</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to identify and describe Canada’s three major environmental issues.</p>

            <h3>Human-Environment Interaction</h3>
            <p>Humans either <strong>adapt</strong> to their environment or <strong>change</strong> it. Canada faces several major environmental challenges caused by human activity.</p>

            <h3>1. Pollution of the Great Lakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Caused by <strong>waste dumping, run-off, and acid rain</strong>.</li>
                <li>Industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals harm aquatic life.</li>
                <li>Acid rain, caused by coal-burning factories and vehicle emissions, makes water toxic.</li>
                <li>Pollution leads to deformities in fish, contaminated drinking water, and human health risks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Mining in the Canadian Shield</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Home to rich deposits of <strong>gold, silver, nickel, and copper</strong>.</li>
                <li>Mining contaminates <strong>soil and water</strong>, disrupting ecosystems.</li>
                <li>Causes <strong>human health issues</strong> due to pollution.</li>
                <li>Short-term economic gain, but long-term environmental damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Deforestation of Timber</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Canada’s <strong>Boreal Forest</strong> is over 10,000 years old.</li>
                <li>Logging for paper and industry destroys animal habitats (e.g., woodland caribou, red fox).</li>
                <li>Forests are a <strong>limited resource</strong>, and deforestation harms biodiversity.</li>
                <li>Cutting trees faster than they can regrow leads to <strong>permanent loss</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
