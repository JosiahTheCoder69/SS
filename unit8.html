        <!-- Canada’s Environmental Issues -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Environmental Issues</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to identify and describe Canada’s three major environmental issues.</p>

            <h3>1. Pollution of the Great Lakes</h3>
            <p>Pollution in the Great Lakes is caused by waste dumping, run-off, and acid rain. Industrial waste and sewage harm aquatic life, and toxic chemicals can cause serious health problems in humans.</p>

            <h3>2. Mining in the Canadian Shield</h3>
            <p>The Canadian Shield is rich in minerals like gold, silver, and nickel. However, mining contaminates soil and water, harming ecosystems and human health.</p>

            <h3>3. Deforestation of Timber</h3>
            <p>Canada’s Boreal Forest is one of the oldest forests in the world. Over-harvesting for paper and industry threatens animal habitats and contributes to environmental damage.</p>

        <!-- Canada’s Economy -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Economy</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to answer Canada’s basic economic questions.</p>

            <h3>Canada’s Economic System</h3>
            <p>Canada has a **mixed economy**, leaning closer to a market system. Private businesses make most decisions, but the government controls some industries, like healthcare.</p>

            <h3>Specialization</h3>
            <p>Canada specializes in **energy, agriculture, and manufacturing**. It is the U.S.’s largest energy supplier and one of the world’s top wheat and grain producers.</p>

            <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Energy:</b> Canada produces oil, natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.</li>
                <li><b>Agriculture:</b> A major supplier of wheat, grain, and other crops.</li>
                <li><b>Manufacturing:</b> Canada produces as many cars as the U.S.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Trade</h3>
            <p>Canada exports resources like energy to the U.S. Over-specialization can make a country too dependent, so diversification is important.</p>

        <!-- Canada’s Government -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Canada’s Government</h2>
            <h3>Learning Target</h3>
            <p>Students will be able to explain how Canada’s government works.</p>

            <h3>Government Structure</h3>
            <p>Canada is a **parliamentary democracy, a constitutional monarchy, and a federation**. Citizens elect Members of Parliament, who choose the Prime Minister.</p>

            <h3>Parliament</h3>
            <p>Canada’s **legislative branch** is called Parliament. It has two parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>House of Commons:</b> Elected by citizens.</li>
                <li><b>Senate:</b> Appointed members.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Branches of Government</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Executive Branch:</b> Led by the Prime Minister.</li>
                <li><b>Legislative Branch:</b> Includes Parliament (House of Commons & Senate).</li>
                <li><b>Judicial Branch:</b> Consists of Canada’s court system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Role of Citizens</h3>
            <p>Canadians vote for Members of Parliament and provincial leaders. They also participate in referendums, like Quebec’s independence votes.</p>
