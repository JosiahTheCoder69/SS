            <h2>Major Themes of Social Studies</h2>
            <p>In this unit, we introduce the key themes that will guide our
            understanding of social studies, such as conflict, culture, governance,
            and human-environment interaction.</p>

            <h2>Conflict and Change</h2>
            <p>Conflict within or between societies often leads to change. This can be
            seen throughout history as societies evolve due to wars, social
            movements, or political disputes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Culture is shaped by religion, beliefs, customs, traditions, and
            government, and it varies across different societies.</p>
